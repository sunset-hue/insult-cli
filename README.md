# `INSULT` - For when insulting yourself isn't enough
INSULT (standing for **I**nsignificant **N**ice **S**also **U**mean **L**CLI **T**ool) is a tool that helps you insult yourself or your codebase, and it can even insult itself!
(also it can compliment itself, but really nothing else)
uhh so yeah it's still a work in progress so i don't really have anything more to say here
